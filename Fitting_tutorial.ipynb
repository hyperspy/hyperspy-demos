    "In order to use fitting in HyperSpy more effectively, it is useful to understand our structure for curve fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main things, related to fitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Model__\n",
    "can be thought of as a simple box (cooking pot), where we have to put our ingredients. Without anything inside, it is not of much use in this case. Once we add some things to it and mix it a bit (do the actual fitting), however, we have our complete dish!\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Component__ is the main building block (ingredient) of our model. Here we mix and match what components we need (or want) for the particular case of signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "- Lorentzian (Cauchy)\n",
    "- Gaussian\n",
    "- Voigt (a combination of Lorentzian and Gaussian)\n",
    "- Offset (i.e. constant background)\n",
    "- Exponential function\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- [create your own or use the very specialised ones!]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the components is ultimately just a function that has variables that change the (shape of the) output. Such a variable in HyperSpy is called a __parameter__. The model is built by combining *linearly* the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Parameter__ is the knob that the fitting routine adjusts for a good fit. Each component must include at least one parameter in order to be able to change when fitting. A parameter is also the object that we may limit or have to adjust when the result of the fit is not satisfactory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, a parameter is the only important thing, as far as the fitting is concerned - components are just smart and convenient boxes to combine parameters into functions, and a model is just a box for a collection of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's just keep the rough structure in our heads and look at other things!\n",
