## Introduction

This repository contains [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to demo and learn
how to process multi-dimensional data with [HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org). For
learning purposes, we recommend to use them alongside the 
[HyperSpy User Guide](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current).

The root folder contains notebooks concerning general HyperSpy features while
the subfolders contain notebooks for specific signals and other more specialized
analyses.

## Visualising and running the demos.

### (Interactive) Running the demos online

[![Live demos (Binder)](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos/main)

Follow [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos/main)
or click the "launch binder" banner above to run the the demos on 
[mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). The demos will run remotely, 
and one can experiment with HyperSpy in a Jupyter notebook with no need 
to install or configure any software locally.

**Note:** depending on the remote server load, the interactive binder demo may 
take up to several minutes to load. For a quicker (but non-interactive) 
visualization, see below.

### (Non-interactive) Visualizing the demos online

[![Notebook Viewer (nbviewer)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg?sanitize=true)](https://nbviewer.org/github/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos)

Follow [this link](https://nbviewer.org/github/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos)
or click on the "render nbviewer" banner above
to display the demos with the 
[Jupyter Notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org). 
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) will allow you to view the notebooks online,
but you will not be able to change them or evaluate any code, like is possible with the 
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos/main).

### Running and visualizing the demos locally

To run the demo notebooks locally, 
clone or download the [demos repository](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos) 
to your local
machine, install HyperSpy and
[Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
and use either of Jupyter tools to run the notebooks.


#### (For developers) Testing the demos locally

To test the demos, install
[nbval](http://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval) and
[py.test](https://pytest.org/) and run

```bash
$ py.test
```

To help visualize differences/errors, install
[nbdime](http://github.com/jupyter/nbdime) as well, and run the test with

```bash
$ py.test --nbdime
```
